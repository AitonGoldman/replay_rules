## III. DAY 1: FULL FIELD PLAY

### 1. Day 1 Format

Day 1’s match play will be a series of five sessions of multiplayer pinball, with multiple games played per
session. In each session, opponents are determined based on each player’s win-loss record. At the end of
the five sessions, players will advance to their respective skill-based divisions.

### 2. Playing a Session

During each session, all players will be assigned to a group. A set of four machines will be randomly
assigned, which will usually consist of one dot-matrix machine (DMD), one electromechanical machine
(EM), one late solid state (LSS) or early dot-matrix machine, and one early solid state (ESS) machine.
Unless a special circumstance arises, players will not be assigned to the same machine set twice. Games
must be played in the order prescribed by the group’s score sheet, since there are multiple groups playing
on the same machine set. Players attempting to “leapfrog” another group or play their assigned machines
out of order may receive a yellow or red card.
Players must go to their assigned groups promptly. If a player is missing, do not start play; inform
tournament organizers of the missing player. Any player who is more than 10 minutes late for their group
will be removed from the group, disqualified from the session, and will automatically receive a 0-12 record
for the session.
Practice or warm-up time is not allowed for anyone during or between sessions. The only designated
practice time is on the morning of Day 1, as listed in the Pinburgh schedule. The best-seeded player within
each group (the first player listed on the scoresheet) chooses their order of play for the first game. The
remaining players choose their order of play, in descending order from best to worst seeding. For
subsequent games, the last-place finisher of the previous game chooses their order of play for the next
game. The remaining players choose their order of play, in ascending order of finish in the previous game
(3rd place, then 2nd place, then 1st place).
All players will play their games and record the results. Exact score ties between two or more players will
be resolved with a one-ball playoff on the same game. When all four games have been completed by a
group, each player will have a win-loss record from the session. The best possible win-loss record for a
session is 12-0 and the worst is 0-12. In three-player groups, win-loss records will be multiplied by a factor
of 1.5. In the unlikely event of a two-player group, win-loss records will be multiplied by a factor of 3.
A group must complete and sign its score sheet for the session, then return it to the Pinburgh tournament
desk. While it is not necessary for the entire group to be present when returning a score sheet, delivery by
more than one player is recommended. Once completed and signed, all score sheets are final. Please
check the score sheet carefully before signing. Prompt entry of score sheets is essential to the timely


progression of the tournament. ~~In any scenario where a player has already defeated his or her opponents
and still has one ball left to play, that ball should be plunged but not played, as it cannot affect the results.
A score must be recorded for the winning player. A player refusing to end their game under these
circumstances may be given a yellow or red card by tournament officials.~~ `I'm not sure why this is in here, under a discussion of score sheets.`
Unsigned score sheets will be processed normally; if there is any dispute that necessitates a ruling, it
must be brought to the attention of tournament coordinators immediately. Once seedings have been
published for the next session, no changes can be made to prior recorded results, except to reverse any
advantage a player may have gained from an incorrect score sheet. Tournament officials will not reverse
any disadvantage a player receives by signing an incorrect score sheet.
Sessions are scheduled for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Please inform tournament officials immediately if a
ruling is needed or if a game is malfunctioning. Move on to the next machine as soon as it is available.

### 3. Game Assignment

A list of the games used in the tournament will be available online in advance of the tournament, and on
[http://​pinburgh.com​](http://​pinburgh.com​) during the tournament.
More than one group of players will be assigned to the same set of machines, and will play in a different
order, so as to minimize delays. Groups may not skip or play machines out of order. In cases where a
game in a group has malfunctioned, a new game may be assigned from the backup area, and the score
sheet will indicate this.

### 4. Seeding Players

Before the first session, all players will be “seeded” in the tournament, using their WPPR ranking as of July
1st. Unranked players will be given the worst available seeds.
Following the first session, players will be “seeded” in the next session by their cumulative win-loss
records, with the best win-loss record receiving the best seed. When seeding a session, ties in win-loss
records will be broken by random draw.

### 5. Group Assignment

The goal of group assignment is to group players with similar rankings.  In order to do this, group assignment for each session is a multi step process.  The first step is to split all players into "tiers" based on their record from previous sessions.  
The highest tier contains the players with the best records, while the lowest tier contains the players with the worst records.
As the day progresses, the tiers are refined to achieve the goal of grouping players with similar rankings.  
The following describes how the tiers are refined given the maximum of 840 players playing : 

__*Session 1 :*__  
- tier 1 - the tier contains all 840 players

__*Session 2 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-300
- tier 2 - contains players ranker 301-600
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 601-840

__*Session 3 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-128
- tier 2 - contains players ranker 129-256
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 257-384
- ...
- tier 7 - contains players ranked 768-840

__*Session 4 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-64
- tier 2 - contains players ranker 65-128
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 66-192
- ...
- tier 14 - contains players ranked 833-840

__*Session 5 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-32
- tier 2 - contains players ranker 33-64
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 65-96
- ...
- tier 27 - contains players ranked 833-840


Within each tier,  groups of 4 players are created.   
The first group is created using the best available seed in the tier, 
the worst available seed in the tier, 
and the two seeds that are closest to the middle of the tier.   
Given that the best and worst and middle seeds for the tier are now in group one, the second group is created using the best *available* seed in the tier and 
the worst *available* seed in the tier and   
and the two *available* seeds that are closest to the middle of the tier.  

In some cases, groups of three will be created instead of groups of 4.

During Session 1, the entire field will play as a single tier, and the arrangement of worst-seeded players in
each group will be reversed. 

In the case of less than maximum number of players playing, there may be up to 3 three-player groups in each session, within the
lowest tier. These groups are the ones that would normally involve the worst-seeded players in each
session. 

If at any time, the number of players in the lowest tier would be exactly 1, 2, or 5, those players will instead
be added to the next-highest tier.  No tier of 4 or fewer players will be created. Those players will instead be assigned to the lowest tier.


### 6. Division Assignment

At the end of Session 5, players will be assigned into their respective divisions.
One-fifth of the field of players will qualify for each Division, rounded up. For example, if there are 100 players
in the tournament, then 20 players will qualify for Division A. 
Any player with a division restriction will
be forced into that division regardless of their win-loss record. For example, an A Division restriction means the player will be forced to play in A Division.
In case of ties, players with the higher record after
Session 4 will be placed in the higher ranked division. Further ties will be broken by higher record after Session 3, after Session
2, after Session 1, and by initial seeding.

With players ordered by ranking, A division will contain the 1st 1/5 of players, B division will contain the next 1/5 of players, and so on.  

##### All remaining players are assigned to Division E.


## IV. DAY 2: DIVISIONAL PLAY

### 1. Day 2 Format

Day 2’s match play is identical to Day 1: a series of five sessions of multiplayer pinball (numbered 6
through 10), with multiple games played per session. In each session, opponents are determined based
on a player’s win-loss rank. At the end of the five sessions, top finishers will advance to Day 3’s finals.
In Division E, players’ records from Day 1 will be disregarded during Day 2’s play. All players in Division E
will start Day 2 with a 0-0 record. In all other divisions, players’ records will not be wiped clean, and
win-loss records from Day 1 are carried over.

### 2. Playing a Session

Sessions on Day 2 play identically to Day 1.
Please remember: Once completed and signed, all score sheets are final. Please check the score sheet
carefully before signing. Score sheets must be turned in as soon as possible, since prompt entry of score
sheets is essential to the timely progression of the tournament.

### 3. Game Assignment

The assignment of games on Day 2 will be performed in the same fashion as on Day 1.

### 4. Seeding Players

Before Session 6, players will be “seeded” by their win-loss record from Day 1, with `ties broken by random
draw.` In Division E, this seeding will be used even though players’ records are wiped before play.
Following Session 6, players will be “seeded” in the next session by their win-loss record, `with ties broken
by random draw.` `Is this correct? Above, we just went through a whole thing about ties being broken by the higher record after sessions, but here we switch to using random draws?`

### 5. Group Assignment

Group assignment on day 2 will follow the same process as day 1, but each division will have separate tiers.  
Assuming that there are a maximum of 840 players, the following describes the tiers per session :  


__*Session 6 :*__  
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-96 in the division
- tier 2 - contains players ranked 97-168 in the division

__*Session 7 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-48 in the division
- tier 2 - contains players ranked 49-96 in the division
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 97-144 in the division
- tier 4 - contains players ranked 145-168 in the division

__*Session 8 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-16 in the division
- tier 2 - contains players ranked 17-32 in the division
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 33-48 in the division
- ...
- tier 11 - contains players ranked 161-168 in the division

__*Session 9 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-8 in the division
- tier 2 - contains players ranked 9-16 in the division
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 17-24 in the division
- ...
- tier 21 - contains players ranked 161-168 in the division

__*Session 10 :*__
- tier 1 - contains players ranked 1-64 in the division
- tier 2 - contains players ranked 65-128 in the division
- tier 3 - contains players ranked 129-168 in the division


### 6. Qualifying for Finals

At the end of Session 10, qualifiers in Division E will be determined by the best win-loss records from
Sessions 6-10. In all other divisions, qualifiers will be determined by the best win-loss records from
Sessions 1-10.
The top 40 players in each division will qualify for finals. The top 16 players in each division will receive a
bye. The top 4 players in each division will receive two byes (directly to the quarterfinals). ~~The #1 player in
each division wins the top qualifier prize.~~ `Nope. Remove.`


Ties for any seeded position, including the qualifying and bye cutoffs ~~and the top qualifier~~, will be broken
by the tied players’ cumulative win-loss records after Session 9, then cumulative win-loss records after
Session 8, and previous sessions’ cumulative records as needed. In the unlikely event that players had the
same win-loss record through all ten sessions, final position will be determined by the original seeding of the tournament. 
No tiebreaking games will be held at the end of Session 10.


## V. DAY 3: FINAL ROUNDS

### 1. Final Rounds

Final rounds employ the same format as session play. All finalists, including finalists with byes,  must check in before the first round.  The deadline to check in is 50 minutes before the first round starts.  Any player who is not checked in will be
disqualified. Players will be moved up in rank, and alternate players will take the worst-seeded positions in
the finals.
Players in final rounds will be placed in four-player groups and play a four-game session in the same
format as Sessions 1-10. The best-seeded player in the group will select from the available sets of
machines for his or her group to play, or may elect to give up this choice to the next player. Choice of sets
will then proceed through the remaining groups, in descending order of seeding, with the best-seeded
player in each group making the choice. At no time will a player be allowed to pick the same set of
machines in consecutive rounds. Each set of machines may be selected by a maximum of two groups.
Some groups will not get to select a machine set.
As in regular Pinburgh sessions, the best-seeded player within each group chooses the order of play for
the first game. The remaining players choose their order, in descending order of seeding. For subsequent
games, the last-place finisher of the previous game chooses the order of play for the next game. The
remaining players choose their order, in ascending order of finish in the previous game.
The top 2 of 4 players in each group, according to win-loss record, will advance to the next round, until the
final four players are determined. These four players will play a final four-game session to determine the
division winner. In case of a significant tie, a one-game playoff will be played on a machine randomly
selected by tournament coordinators among finals machines in other machine sets, with the best-seeded
player having the choice of play order. In case of a tie between the first and second-place finishers in a
group, both players advance and a tiebreaker is not required.
No warm-up or practice time will be provided to any finalist on any machine.
The #1-#4 seeds pass through to the quarterfinals, and the #5-16 seeds pass through to the second
round. For the first round of finals the players will be split into 6 groups based on the following: 
First Round, Group 1: #17 seed, #28 seed, #29 seed, #40 seed
First Round, Group 2: #18 seed, #27 seed, #30 seed, #39 seed
First Round, Group 3: #19 seed, #26 seed, #31 seed, #38 seed
First Round, Group 4: #20 seed, #25 seed, #32 seed, #37 seed
First Round, Group 5: #21 seed, #24 seed, #33 seed, #36 seed
First Round, Group 6: #22 seed, #23 seed, #34 seed, #35 seed

Two players from each group, for a total of twelve players, will advance to the second round to join the
#5-#16 seeds. All 26 players will be re-ranked according to their qualifying seeding, and split into 6 groups based on the following:
Second Round, Group 1: #5 rank, #16 rank, #17 rank, #28 rank
Second Round, Group 2: #6 rank, #15 rank, #18 rank, #27 rank
Second Round, Group 3: #7 rank, #14 rank, #19 rank, #26 rank
Second Round, Group 4: #8 rank, #13 rank, #20 rank, #25 rank
Second Round, Group 5: #9 rank, #12 rank, #21 rank, #24 rank
Second Round, Group 6: #10 rank, #11 rank, #22 rank, #23 rank

Two players from each group, for a total of twelve players, will advance to quarterfinal rounds to join the
#1-#4 seeds. All 16 players are re-ranked according to their qualifying seeding, and split into 4 groups based on the following:
as shown here:
Quarterfinals, Group 1: #1 rank, #8 rank, #9 rank, #16 rank
Quarterfinals, Group 2: #2 rank, #7 rank, #10 rank, #17 rank
Quarterfinals, Group 3: #3 rank, #6 rank, #11 rank, #18 rank
Quarterfinals, Group 4: #4 rank, #5 rank, #12 rank, #19 rank

Two players from each group, for a total of eight players, will advance to semifinal rounds. All 8 players
are re-ranked according to their qualifying seeding, and split into 2  groups as based on the following:
Semifinals, Group 1: #1 rank, #4 rank, #5 rank, #8 rank
Semifinals, Group 2: #2 rank, #3 rank, #6 rank, #7 rank

Two players from each group, for a total of four players, will advance to the final round.


## VI. MALFUNCTIONS & RULINGS

Most malfunctions and rulings are governed by the full PAPA ruleset. The specific rules below supersede
the full PAPA ruleset, found at https://papa.org/competitions/competition-rules.

### 1. Major Malfunctions

If a major malfunction occurs that will require significant repairs, tournament coordinators may declare a
“Disabled Machine” (see section below). Because the tournament needs to move quickly from session to
session, it is not possible to make significant repairs during a match. A new machine will be assigned to
the group for immediate play, and the game in progress will be declared void.
In the event that two or more different major malfunctions take place during the same game, the machine
will be declared “Disabled” and a new machine will be assigned to the group for immediate play. During
final rounds, if the first machine in a set is disabled, the machine set selection process will be restarted, if
possible.

### 3. Beneficial Malfunctions

Any situation which indicates the presence of a beneficial malfunction should be brought to the attention
of tournament coordinators immediately. Any player who intentionally takes advantage of a significant
beneficial malfunction may be given a score of zero by tournament coordinators.
A significant beneficial malfunction occurs if a machine gives an unearned multiball by releasing locked
balls, placing two balls in the plunger lane, or kicking additional balls into play when not an intended part
of gameplay. In these situations, the player must immediately drain all additional balls, or trap the balls so
that a tournament coordinator can do so. Any player who intentionally plays an unearned multiball will be
given a score of zero by tournament coordinators. `
If a beneficial malfunction has significantly increased the score of any player(s), affected players’ scores
will be void, as described in “Catastrophic Malfunctions”. Tournament coordinators will determine
whether it is appropriate to continue play on the same machine or declare it Disabled.

### 4. Disabled Machines

Any tournament machine that breaks down during play will be attended to by technicians as soon as
possible. In the event that a breakdown cannot be repaired, the machine may be taken out of service
temporarily or permanently. Results on that machine from prior sessions will not be disqualified, and the
machine will be replaced by another machine selected by tournament coordinators.
Tournament coordinators may choose to disable a machine for any reason during or between sessions of
play. Typical reasons may include malfunctions, incorrect settings, or unusually long playtime.


### 5. Player Errors

Coaching of any player while he or she is at a machine is not allowed and may lead to sanctions.
Spectators and other players must refrain from commenting on play in a way that affects the current
game.
No player may use reference materials of any kind, whether printed or electronic, while playing his or her
ball. Reference materials may be used at any other time, however, even during a session or final round.


## VII. MACHINE SETTINGS

Most rules governing machine settings are identical to the full PAPA ruleset. The specific rules below
supersede the full PAPA ruleset, found at https://papa.org/competitions/competition-rules.

### 1. Software Settings

Please note that older machines may have different settings, such as allowable extra balls, five-ball play,
or a Tilt penalty of “entire game” rather than “current ball”. Players will play the game “as is”, even if there
is no sign indicating an expected change in machine behavior. For example, if a machine is set for
five-ball play, groups may not end the game after three balls. Electromechanical machines will generally
be set for five-ball play, but if they are set for three, they will be played as three. Please contact
tournament officials if a game is acting in an unusual way.
A few machines have been designated as single-player games, even though they may support multiple
players, due to “catch up” features or other issues with significant competitive impact. These machines
will have signs on them, and will be marked as such on score sheets.


## VIII. PLAYER CONDUCT

Most rules governing player conduct are identical to the full PAPA ruleset. The specific rules below
supersede the full PAPA ruleset, found at https://papa.org/competitions/competition-rules.

### 1. Absences

When session groups are announced, all players must proceed immediately to their assigned set of
machines and check-in with the other players in their assigned groups. If a player is absent, tournament
officials must be notified promptly. An announcement may or may not be made to attempt to locate the
absent player. Any player absent 10 minutes after a session’s start time will be disqualified from the
session, and will receive a score of 0-12.
When a player is determined to be absent, tournament officials will alter the affected group appropriately,
recognizing that other groups will have begun play and should not be unduly disrupted. 4-player groups
will continue as 3-player groups.
Under extraordinary circumstances due to multiple player absences, a 2-player group or even a 1-player
group may be forced to play. In the event of a 2-player group, four machines will be played and the record
will be tripled, yielding the standard point opportunity to each player. In the event of a 1-player group, the
player will be assigned to “shadow” an existing 4-player group and play three of the same machines. Wins
and losses will be assigned for that player, competing against 4 opponents in each game, but
corresponding wins and losses will not accrue to players in the 4-player group. 
If a player who was present initially cannot be found during the play of a group, tournament officials must
be notified promptly. That player will be allowed no more than 3 minutes to return. If he or she does not
return, that player will receive a score of zero for the game. Each ball for that player will be plunged and
left unplayed. Any player who has more than one such absence may be disqualified from the tournament.
Any player who is absent at the beginning of two consecutive sessions without notifying tournament
coordinators of an emergency in advance will be disqualified from the tournament.
Any player who is not present at the beginning of finals will be disqualified and replaced by the next
lower-ranked player. Any player who is absent during final rounds will be subjected to the rules described
above for absences during group play.
At no time may any person be substituted for an absent player.

### 2. Disallowed Practice

Practicing on any tournament machine except during the designated times on Thursday morning is
strictly forbidden. Practice will be treated as interference and penalized accordingly. Note in particular
that there is no practice time for finalists at any time on Saturday.


## IX. MISCELLANEOUS

All miscellaneous rules are identical to the full PAPA ruleset, found at
https://papa.org/competitions/competition-rules. Additional, superseding rules are listed below.

### 1. Special Score Handling

Any player who reaches the maximum possible score on a machine that has such a limit, will receive that
score as their total. If two or more players reach the maximum possible score on the same game, those
players will be considered tied for that game.
During sessions, any player whose machine “rolls over” to a zero score is responsible for confirming this
with his or her opponents before and after the rollover occurs.
Tournament officials may declare a player as a winner of a game in progress; that player will get a record
of 3-0 for that game. This will generally occur only if the pace of the tournament is at risk due to
exceptionally good play. The affected player must stop play immediately. Any other player reaching the
same score in that game will also receive a 3-0 record.
In the event that any player's order of finish is known, but specific scores are no longer retrievable, the
order of finish will be considered correct, and approximate scores may be recorded that correspond to the
correct and known order of finish.

### 2. Event Disruption

In the event of a power outage, large disruption, or similar circumstance that impacts the Pinburgh
schedule in a significant way, tournament officials retain the right to shorten any phase of the
tournament, including but not limited to shortening rounds, eliminating rounds, adjusting the number of
qualifiers and prize amounts, or rescheduling portions of the tournament. All decisions made by
tournament directors in this regard are final, and no refunds will be issued should a large disruption of the
nature discussed here trigger the enforcement of this rule. By participating in Pinburgh, all players
understand and accept the risk that large disruptions outside the control of Pinburgh and Replay FX staff
could potentially impact the event and force alterations to the schedule and other related aspects of the
tournament.
