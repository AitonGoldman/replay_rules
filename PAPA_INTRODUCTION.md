This document contains the rules for the _PAPA World Pinball Championships_. This document is also the baseline
for all PAPA-related competitive pinball rulings. _Leagues and tournaments are welcome to copy these rules and
adapt them as needed but are required, as per the Creative Commons license, to cite the original source_  **PAPA.org**
_within their own ruleset._ This document is actively updated, and all leagues and tournaments using this ruleset as a
baseline are encouraged to update their own rules at least once per year.

The Pinburgh Match-Play Championships ruleset contains adjustments that supersede portions of this document
for that specific tournament.

All players, winning or not, grant PAPA, Replay Foundation, and any and all other event sponsors and organizers,
individual and collective, the right to use their names, scores, and likenesses for the purpose of promoting
pinball-related events. This right is transferable without restriction. Video recording and photography occur at all
PAPA events.

The event coordinators for the PAPA World Championships are Kevin Martin, Mark Steinman, Elizabeth Cromwell,
and Douglas Polka. Event coordinators organize volunteers, designate scorekeepers, handle malfunctions and
rulings, delegate responsibilities and authority, and otherwise work to ensure the smooth operation of the
tournament. Event coordinators and designated officials may participate in the tournament, but their tickets will
automatically be considered void at all times, and they are not eligible to participate in any final rounds or to receive
prizes of any kind.
